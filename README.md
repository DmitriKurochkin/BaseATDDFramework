# BaseATDDFramework

This is a base [Acceptance Test-Driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development) framework created using [Page Object pattern](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#page-object-design-pattern).

[Specflow](http://specflow.org/) is a Gherkin language implementation for .NET platform. Specflow helps to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects. Writing easily understandable tests is a cornerstone of the [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) paradigm and also helps build up a living documentation of your system.
